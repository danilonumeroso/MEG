# MEG: Molecular Explanation Generator
This repository contains the implementation of MEG, a novel approach tackling the problem of Interpretability
of Deep Graph Networks (DGN) in the context of molecule property prediction tasks. MEG is a Reinforcement Learning
agent generating informative **counterfactual explanations** for a specific prediction under the form of (valid)
chemical compounds with high structural similarity and different predicted properties. 
We base the implementation of our agent on the [MolDQN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.08678) model.
